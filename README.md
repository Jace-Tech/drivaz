- Native Base

## Challenges

- DESIGN:
  Because I wasnâ€™t given a design to use and work on the test, It was pretty hard for me to come up with one. I had to browse for some online and I couldnâ€™t find any that meets my need, Probably because Iâ€™m not much of a UI person and also the color I love where not in them (PS: The colors I like are BLACK and WHITE ðŸ¤£)

- TASK QUESTION:
  You know you mentioned *Todo App* earlier before diving into *Driverâ€™s System*, and also you only mention about 2 important stuffs you needed; ie: The *Single Page* and *Search Page*, I forgot to ask for more detail before the call ended because I thought I have said a lot already. So I finally decided to make it in form of a CRUD application for Drivers

- PACKAGES:
  I didnâ€™t know if I was supposed to use any package for this task, so if Iâ€™m not supposed to; Iâ€™m sorry and I used some, and If Iâ€™m allowed to use some then AWESOME!
